# JARVIS - Just A Rather Very Intelligent System

A Python-based voice assistant that can execute commands, open applications, and answer questions using Google's Gemini AI.

## Features

âœ¨ **Voice Commands** - Control your computer with natural speech
ðŸŽ¤ **Continuous Listening** - Always ready without restart delays
ðŸ¤– **AI-Powered** - Uses Google Gemini for intelligent responses
ðŸš€ **Quick Actions** - Open apps, browsers, and system tools instantly

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KrishnaSrinivas-24/JARVIS.git
cd JARVIS
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up your Google Gemini API key:
   - Get your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
   - Replace `"Paste your API Here"` in `jarvis.py` with your actual API key

## Usage

## Recent Improvements

### Continuous Listening Optimization (Issue #1)
- âœ… Removed recursive restart after unknown responses
- âœ… Added proper error handling for all speech recognition exceptions
- âœ… Implemented timeout and phrase limits to prevent hanging
- âœ… Added ambient noise adjustment for better recognition
- âœ… Continuous loop without restart delays

**Benefits:**
- No more infinite loops on recognition errors
- Faster response time between commands
- Better error recovery
- Smoother user experience

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Microphone access
- Internet connection (for speech recognition and Gemini AI)
- Windows OS (for application shortcuts)
